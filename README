How to install:

We now use Python's Distutils for this package.

To download prerequisites (crypto++, pyutil):

  python setup.py download
  
To install type:

  python setup.py install

To test before you install:

  python setup.py test

Win32 Notes:

To compile using mingw32 first:
  
  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32

or create a file named setup.cfg in the same dir with the following two lines:
  [build]
  compiler=mingw32

This will allow you to just run test without building by hand first.

  
  
This will run all the unit tests found in tests/

Soon we hope to have some better examples of how to use this in examples/

How to learn the API:

0.  Read the file named "Tutorial.txt" in the egtp/ directory.

1.  The example: Look at EGTPunittest.py, in the function named 
`_help_test_EGTP_send_and_receive()' to see basic operation of creating nodes 
and sending and receiving messages.

2.  The interface that provides messaging:  Look at the interface of class Node in Node.py.

3.  The interfaces that provide lookup and discovery:  Look at the interfaces for lookup managers, 
lookup handlers, discovery managers, and discovery handlers in interfaces.py.

3.a.
    You can see implementations of the manager classes (local, non-distributed, for-testing-only) in 
    EGTPtest.py.

3.b.
    You can see how EGTP uses the manager classes in MojoTransaction.py (see how it uses the 
    `self._lookupman' member) and RelayListener.py (see how it uses the `self._discoveryman' member).

3.c.
    You can see how EGTP defines and uses handler classes in MojoTransaction.py 
    (class LookupHand) and in RelayListener.py (class ShoppingResultsHand).
